# DECIPHER

## Dependencies & Environment

> Package-intrinsic requirements from the Bioconductor landing page — reproduce in any R environment.

- **Version:** 3.8.0 · **Bioconductor:** 3.23 · **R:** ≥ 4.6
- **Depends:** Biostrings
- **Imports:** DBI, S4Vectors, IRanges, XVector
- **Install:** `BiocManager::install("DECIPHER")`

## When to Use
- **Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)**: Aligning large sets of DNA, RNA, or amino acid sequences directly in R with high accuracy.
- **Taxonomic Classification**: Classifying marker gene sequences (e.g., 16S/18S rRNA, ITS) using the robust IDTAXA algorithm.
- **Large-Scale Sequence Clustering**: Grouping millions of sequences into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) or clusters using memory-efficient database-backed methods.
- **Primer and Probe Design**: Designing and validating group-specific PCR primers, microarrays, and FISH probes targeting specific taxonomic groups.
- **Gene Finding & Chimera Detection**: Identifying protein-coding genes, non-coding RNAs, or chimeric sequences in metagenomic and genomic assemblies.

## When NOT to Use
- For basic, small-scale alignments where simple command-line tools like ClustalW or MUSCLE are already integrated into your pipeline, use `msa` instead because DECIPHER has a steeper learning curve due to its SQLite database backend.
- For ultra-fast, heuristic clustering of millions of raw metagenomic reads without downstream R analysis, use external command-line tools like `MMseqs2` or `vsearch` because they are optimized for raw disk-based speed.
- For phylogenetic tree reconstruction using advanced evolutionary models (e.g., Maximum Likelihood or Bayesian), use `phangorn` or `ggtree` because DECIPHER's tree-building (`TreeLine`) is primarily distance-based.

## Data Requirements
- **Input Formats**: FASTA, FASTQ, GenBank, or EMBL files.
- **R Objects**: `DNAStringSet`, `RNAStringSet`, or `AAStringSet` objects from the `Biostrings` package.
- **Database Structure**: Utilizes an SQLite database connection (`DECIPHER.sqlite`) to handle extremely large sequence datasets without memory exhaustion.

## Key Parameters
- **myXStringSet**: The input sequence object (e.g., `DNAStringSet`) to be aligned, clustered, or classified.
- **processors** (`1`): Number of CPU cores to use for parallelized operations (set to `NULL` to auto-detect all available cores).
- **verbose** (`TRUE`): Logical indicating whether to display progress bars and detailed execution information.
- **threshold** (`0.05`): Distance threshold for clustering sequences into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs).
- **cutoff** (`60`): Confidence threshold for taxonomic classification using the IDTAXA algorithm.
- **minProductSize** (`75`): Minimum product size when designing PCR primers.

## Best Practices
- **Database Storage**: For large datasets, initialize a local SQLite database using `dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), ...)` to store and query sequences efficiently instead of keeping them all in RAM.
- **Sequence Orientation**: Always run `OrientNucleotides()` on your input `DNAStringSet` prior to alignment or classification to ensure all sequences are in the same 5'-to-3' orientation.
- **Classifier Training**: When using `IdTaxa` for classification, ensure you train the classifier using a high-quality, curated training set (e.g., SILVA or RDP) formatted specifically for DECIPHER.
- **Quality Control**: Filter out low-quality reads, adapter sequences, and excessive ambiguous bases (`N`s) before running multiple sequence alignments.

## Common Pitfalls
- **Memory Exhaustion**: Attempting to align millions of long sequences in-memory can crash R. *Fix*: Use the database-backed functions (`DBToSeqs` / `SeqsToDB`) or subset the sequences into representative clusters first.
- **Incorrect Sequence Orientation**: Aligning sequences where some are reverse-complemented leads to poor alignment quality. *Fix*: Run `OrientNucleotides()` on the input `DNAStringSet` before alignment.
- **Mismatched Training Set for IDTAXA**: Using an outdated or improperly formatted training object results in low classification confidence or errors. *Fix*: Download pre-trained classifiers from the official DECIPHER website or strictly follow the training vignette.

## Alternatives
- **msa**: For a unified interface to ClustalW, ClustalOmega, and Muscle alignments in R.
- **Biostrings**: For basic sequence manipulation, pattern matching, and pairwise alignments.
- **dada2**: For high-resolution sample inference from amplicon data (ASV generation).
- **taxonomizr**: For assigning taxonomy to NCBI accession numbers.
