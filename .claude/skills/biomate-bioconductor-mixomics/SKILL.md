# mixOmics

## Dependencies & Environment

> Package-intrinsic requirements from the Bioconductor landing page — reproduce in any R environment.

- **Version:** 6.36.0 · **Bioconductor:** 3.23 · **R:** ≥ 4.6
- **Depends:** MASS, lattice, ggplot2
- **Imports:** igraph, ellipse, corpcor, RColorBrewer, dplyr, tidyr, reshape2, matrixStats, rARPACK, gridExtra, ggrepel, BiocParallel, rgl, rlang
- **Install:** `BiocManager::install("mixOmics")`

## When to Use
- Performing unsupervised exploratory analysis and dimensionality reduction using `pca` and `spca`.
- Integrating multiple omics datasets measured on the same samples (N-integration) using DIABLO.
- Conducting supervised classification and feature selection for multi-class problems using `splsda`.

## When NOT to Use
- For simple univariate differential expression, use `limma` or `DESeq2` instead because `mixOmics` is designed for multivariate feature selection and integration.
- For raw mass spectrometry or sequencing read preprocessing, use `xcms` or `edgeR` for normalization, as `mixOmics` requires pre-processed, normalized continuous matrices.

## Data Requirements
- Input: Numeric data matrix or data frames with $N$ observations (samples) in rows and $P$ predictors (variables) in columns.
- Pre-filtering: Data should be pre-filtered (e.g., < 10K predictors) to remove near-zero variance predictors and reduce computational time.
- Normalization: Data must be normalized prior to analysis (e.g., log-transformed for transcriptomics, CLR-transformed for compositional microbiome data).

## Key Parameters
- **ncomp** (none): The number of principal components or latent dimensions to extract in `pca`, `spca`, or `splsda`.
- **scale** (TRUE): Logical indicating whether to scale variables to unit variance before analysis in `pca` or `tune.pca`.
- **center** (TRUE): Logical indicating whether to center variables to zero mean in `pca`.
- **keepX** (none): A numeric vector specifying the number of variables to select on each component in sparse methods like `spca`.
- **comp** (none): Specifies which components to plot in `plotIndiv` or `plotVar` (e.g., `c(1, 2)`).
- **group** (none): Factor vector used to color samples by class in `plotIndiv` or `biplot`.

## Best Practices
- Use `tune.pca` to evaluate the cumulative proportion of explained variance and choose the optimal `ncomp` via a screeplot.
- Center and scale the data in `pca` to ensure variables with large variances do not dominate the components.
- Use `selectVar` to extract and rank the most important variables contributing to each component.
- Visualize sample clustering with `plotIndiv` and variable correlations with `plotVar` (correlation circle plot).

## Common Pitfalls
- **Misinterpreting correlation circle plots on unscaled data**: If data is not scaled, cosine angles do not accurately reflect correlations; fix this by ensuring `scale = TRUE` is set in the PCA/PLS method.
- **Overfitting in supervised models**: Using PLS-DA without cross-validation can yield perfect separation by chance; fix this by using cross-validation functions like `perf` and `tune.splsda` to objectively select `ncomp` and `keepX`.
- **Incorrect data orientation**: `mixOmics` expects samples in rows and variables in columns; fix this by transposing the matrix if samples are in columns.

## Alternatives
- **MOFA2**: Differs by using Bayesian Group Factor Analysis for multi-omics integration, handling missing values natively.
- **RGCCA**: Differs by focusing on regularized generalized canonical correlation analysis, which forms the theoretical basis for some mixOmics methods but offers different tuning.
