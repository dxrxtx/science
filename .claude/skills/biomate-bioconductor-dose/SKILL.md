# DOSE

## Dependencies & Environment

> Package-intrinsic requirements from the Bioconductor landing page — reproduce in any R environment.

- **Version:** 4.6.0 · **Bioconductor:** 3.23 · **R:** ≥ 4.6
- **Imports:** AnnotationDbi, enrichit, ggplot2, GOSemSim, reshape2, yulab.utils
- **Install:** `BiocManager::install("DOSE")`

## When to Use
- **Disease Ontology Analysis**: Performing Disease Ontology Semantic and Enrichment analysis as described by the package authors.

## When NOT to Use
- For formatting R markdown documents, use `knitr` because DOSE is strictly for Disease Ontology analysis.

## Data Requirements
- Requires loading the package into the R session via `library(DOSE)`.

## Key Parameters
- **pkg**: Used in the `Biocpkg` function example to format package links.
- **tidy**: Used in `knitr::opts_chunk$set` to control code formatting.

## Best Practices
- Load the package using `library(DOSE)`.
- Cite the primary publication (Yu et al. 2015) when using DOSE in published research.

## Common Pitfalls
- **Missing Citation**: Forgetting to cite the package in publications; fix by including the citation to Bioinformatics 2015.

## Alternatives
- **knitr**: For document generation and vignette formatting, as it handles markdown chunk options rather than biological enrichment.
