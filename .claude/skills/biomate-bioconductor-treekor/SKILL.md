# treekoR

## Workflows

### Standard Workflow

Identify robust associations between hierarchical cell subsets and clinical outcomes from single-cell cytometry data.

```r
library(treekoR)
library(SingleCellExperiment)

# Load data
data(COVIDSampleData)
sce <- DeBiasi_COVID_CD8_samp

exprs <- t(assay(sce, "exprs"))
clusters <- colData(sce)$cluster_id
classes <- colData(sce)$condition
samples <- colData(sce)$sample_id

# 1. Construct the hierarchical tree of clusters using getClusterTree (hopach)
clust_tree <- getClusterTree(exprs, clusters, hierarchy_method="hopach")

# 2. Perform significance testing of cell subpopulations using testTree
tested_tree <- testTree(phylo=clust_tree$clust_tree, clusters=clusters, samples=samples, classes=classes, pos_class_name=NULL)

# 3. Extract significance results using getTreeResults
res_df <- getTreeResults(tested_tree)

# 4. Visualize results interactively using plotInteractiveHeatmap
plotInteractiveHeatmap(tested_tree, clust_med_df = clust_tree$median_freq, clusters=clusters)

# 5. Construct tree with average linkage, test, and plot
clust_tree_avg <- getClusterTree(exprs, clusters, hierarchy_method="average")
tested_tree_avg <- testTree(clust_tree_avg$clust_tree, clusters=clusters, samples=samples, classes=classes, pos_class_name=NULL)
plotInteractiveHeatmap(tested_tree_avg, clust_med_df = clust_tree_avg$median_freq, clusters=clusters)

# 6. Construct tree with hopach, test with edgeR, and plot
tested_tree_edgeR <- testTree(clust_tree$clust_tree, clusters=clusters, samples=samples, classes=classes, sig_test="edgeR", pos_class_name="COV")
plotInteractiveHeatmap(tested_tree_edgeR, clust_med_df = clust_tree$median_freq, clusters=clusters)

# 7. Extract cell proportions (%total and %parent) using getCellProp
prop_df <- getCellProp(phylo=clust_tree$clust_tree, clusters=clusters, samples=samples, classes=classes)

# 8. Extract marker geometric means per cell type using getCellGMeans
means_df <- getCellGMeans(clust_tree$clust_tree, exprs=exprs, clusters=clusters, samples=samples, classes=classes)
```
*Inputs are single-cell expression matrix, cluster IDs, sample IDs, and clinical classes; outputs are tested tree objects, proportion data frames, and interactive heatmaps.*

## When to Use
- When analyzing single-cell cytometry or flow cytometry data with hierarchical cell populations.
- To find robust associations between cell subset proportions (both %total and %parent) and patient clinical outcomes.
- To extract marker geometric means per cell type across samples for downstream machine learning or visualization.

## When NOT to Use
- For standard single-cell RNA-seq differential gene expression analysis within a single cell type; use `DESeq2`, `edgeR`, or `limma` instead.
- When cell populations do not exhibit a hierarchical or nested lineage structure.

## Data Requirements
- **exprs**: Single-cell expression matrix ($n \times p$) where $p$ is the number of markers and $n$ is the number of cells.
- **clusters**: A vector of length $n$ representing the cell type or cluster of each cell (character or numeric).
- **classes**: A vector of length $n$ containing the patient outcome/class each cell belongs to.
- **samples**: A vector of length $n$ identifying the patient/sample each cell belongs to.

## Key Parameters
- **hierarchy_method** ("hopach"): Method to construct the hierarchical tree. Options include `"hopach"` or any `hclust` method (e.g., `"average"`, `"complete"`, `"ward.D"`).
- **sig_test** ("ttest"): Significance test to use. Options include `"ttest"`, `"GLMM"`, or `"edgeR"`.
- **pos_class_name** (NULL): Name of the positive class of interest for testing (e.g., `"COV"`).

## Best Practices
- Use HOPACH (`hierarchy_method="hopach"`) as the default method to automatically determine the tree structure of cell clusters.
- Measure both `%parent` (proportion relative to immediate parent node) and `%total` (proportion relative to all cells) to capture nested proportions.
- Use `plotInteractiveHeatmap` to simultaneously visualize the hierarchical tree (colored by test statistics) and the median marker expression heatmap.

## Common Pitfalls
- **Ignoring hierarchical structure**: Only analyzing `%total` proportions, which overlooks nested subpopulation changes. *Fix*: Use `testTree` to calculate and test both `%total` and `%parent` proportions.
- **Incorrect positive class specification**: Specifying a non-existent class name in `pos_class_name` when using `sig_test="edgeR"`. *Fix*: Ensure `pos_class_name` matches one of the unique values in the `classes` vector (e.g., `"COV"`).

## Alternatives
- `diffcyt`: For high-dimensional cytometry differential analysis using GLMM or edgeR without hierarchical tree structures.
- `Citrus`: For supervised identification of stratifying cell populations.
- `scda`: For general single-cell differential abundance analysis.
