# SingleR

## Dependencies & Environment

> Package-intrinsic requirements from the Bioconductor landing page — reproduce in any R environment.

- **Version:** 2.14.0 · **Bioconductor:** 3.23 · **R:** ≥ 4.6
- **Depends:** SummarizedExperiment
- **Imports:** Matrix, BiocGenerics, S4Vectors, DelayedArray, Rcpp, beachmat
- **System requirements:** C++17
- **Install:** `BiocManager::install("SingleR")`

## When to Use
- Annotating unlabelled single-cell datasets using pre-labelled reference datasets (e.g., `HumanPrimaryCellAtlasData()`).
- Propagating biological knowledge to new datasets in an automated manner without manually interpreting clusters.
- Resolving closely related cell type labels using fine-tuning.

## When NOT to Use
- For unsupervised clustering without a reference (use `scran` instead because `SingleR` requires known labels).
- For manual marker gene definition and cluster interpretation (use `Seurat` instead because `SingleR` automates this using a reference).

## Data Requirements
- **Test dataset**: Unlogged counts are acceptable, as only ranks are used by `SingleR()`.
- **Reference dataset**: Must be normalized and log-transformed (e.g., using `normalizeRnaCounts.se()`).

## Key Parameters
- **test**: The unlabelled single-cell dataset to be annotated.
- **ref**: The pre-labelled reference dataset.
- **labels**: The cell type labels corresponding to the reference dataset.
- **assay.type.test**: The assay index or name to use from the test dataset.
- **de.method**: The marker detection mode (e.g., `"wilcox"` for single-cell references).

## Best Practices
- Perform cell-based quality control before running `SingleR()`.
- Normalize and log-transform reference datasets using `normalizeRnaCounts.se()`.
- Inspect assignment confidence using `plotScoreHeatmap()` and `plotDeltaDistribution()`.
- Remove poor-quality or ambiguous assignments using `pruneScores()`.
- Examine the expression of marker genes for each label in the test dataset using `plotMarkerHeatmap()`.

## Common Pitfalls
- Using raw counts for the reference (fix: log-transform and normalize the reference first using `normalizeRnaCounts.se()`).
- Default marker detection failing on low-coverage data (fix: use `de.method="wilcox"` to consider variance of expression across cells).
- Uncertain assignments for cells whose true label does not exist in the reference (fix: inspect per-cell deltas and use `pruneScores()` to replace low-quality assignments with `NA`).

## Alternatives
- `Seurat` (for manual marker gene definition and cluster interpretation).
- `scmap` (for projection-based single-cell annotation).
