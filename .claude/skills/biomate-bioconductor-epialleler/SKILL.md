name: biomate-bioconductor-epialleler
description: Epialleles are specific DNA methylation patterns that are mitotically and/or meiotically inherited. This package calls and reports cytosine methylation as well as frequencies of hypermethylated epialleles at the level of genomic regions or individual cytosines in next-generation sequencing data using binary alignment map (BAM) files as an input. Among other things, this package can also extract and visualise methylation patterns and assess allele specificity of methylation.

## Workflows

### Standard Workflow

```r
library(epialleler)
capture.bam <- system.file("extdata", "capture.bam", package="epialleler")
capture.bed <- system.file("extdata", "capture.bed", package="epialleler")
bam.data <- preprocessBam(capture.bam, targets=capture.bed)
cg.vef.report <- generateCytosineReport(bam.data)
```
*Note*: Inputs are a short-read BAM file and a target BED file; output is a data.table containing the cytosine VEF report.

### Long Read Methylation Analysis

```r
library(epialleler)
longread.bam <- system.file("extdata", "longread.bam", package="epialleler")
longread.data <- preprocessBam(longread.bam, min.mapq=30, min.baseq=20, min.prob=178)
cg.report <- generateCytosineReport(longread.data, threshold.reads=FALSE)
```
*Note*: Input is a long-read BAM file; output is a conventional cytosine report.

### Methylation Bimodality Ecdf

```r
library(epialleler)
# Assess potential bimodality of methylation for genomic regions of interest
# generateBedEcdf(bam, bed)
```
*Note*: Inputs are a BAM file and a BED file of genomic regions; output is an assessment of methylation bimodality.

### Methylation Calling Unannotated Bams

```r
library(epialleler)
input.bam <- system.file("extdata", "test", "bwameth-se-unsort-yd.bam", package="epialleler")
output.bam <- tempfile(pattern="output-", fileext=".bam")
genome <- preprocessGenome(system.file("extdata", "test", "reference.fasta.gz", package="epialleler"))
callMethylation(input.bam, output.bam, genome)
```
*Note*: Inputs are an unannotated BAM file and a preprocessed reference genome; output is a new BAM file containing XG/XM tags.

### Sequence Variant Association

```r
library(epialleler)
# Test the association of methylation with single-nucleotide variations within epialleles
# generateVcfReport(bam, vcf)
```
*Note*: Inputs are a BAM file and a VCF file; output is a VCF report testing SNV-epiallele association.

### Long Read Methylation Reporting

```r
library(epialleler)
longread.bam <- system.file("extdata", "longread.bam", package="epialleler")
longread.data <- preprocessBam(longread.bam, min.mapq=30, min.baseq=20, min.prob=178)
cg.report <- generateCytosineReport(longread.data, threshold.reads=FALSE)
```
*Note*: Input is a long-read BAM file; output is a conventional cytosine report.

### Methylation Pattern And Ecdf Visualization

```r
library(epialleler)
# Explore DNA methylation patterns of genomic regions of interest
# patterns <- extractPatterns(bam, bed)
# plotPatterns(patterns)
```
*Note*: Inputs are a BAM file and a BED file; output is a visualization of methylation patterns.

### Short Read Methylation Calling

```r
library(epialleler)
input.bam <- system.file("extdata", "test", "bwameth-se-unsort-yd.bam", package="epialleler")
output.bam <- tempfile(pattern="output-", fileext=".bam")
genome <- preprocessGenome(system.file("extdata", "test", "reference.fasta.gz", package="epialleler"))
callMethylation(input.bam, output.bam, genome)
```
*Note*: Inputs are an unannotated BAM file and a preprocessed reference genome; output is a new BAM file containing XG/XM tags.

### Snv Epiallele Association

```r
library(epialleler)
# Test the association of methylation with single-nucleotide variations within epialleles
# generateVcfReport(bam, vcf)
```
*Note*: Inputs are a BAM file and a VCF file; output is a VCF report testing SNV-epiallele association.

## When to Use
- To call and report cytosine methylation levels (beta values) and variant epiallele frequencies (VEF) of hypermethylated alleles from BAM files.
- To analyze DNA methylation patterns at the level of individual cytosines (`generateCytosineReport`) or genomic regions (`generateBedReport`, `generateAmpliconReport`, `generateCaptureReport`).
- To call methylation on unannotated short-read BAM files lacking XG/XM tags using `callMethylation` and a preprocessed reference genome (`preprocessGenome`).

## When NOT to Use
- For long-read sequencing where thresholding is not recommended; use `generateMhlReport` to calculate Linearised Methylated Haplotype Load (lMHL) instead of VEF.
- For multi-threaded BAM reading/writing if HTSlib is not configured; though `nthreads` can speed up decompression.

## Data Requirements
- **BAM files**: Short-read BAMs must contain XG and XM tags (or be processed with `callMethylation`). Long-read BAMs must contain MM and ML tags.
- **BED files**: Genomic coordinates for targeted regions (amplicon or capture).
- **FASTA files**: Reference genome sequence (only required for short-read methylation calling via `preprocessGenome`).

## Key Parameters
- **bam**: Path to the input BAM file or preprocessed BAM data.
- **threshold.reads** (TRUE): Whether to produce a thresholded (VEF) report. Set to `FALSE` for conventional cytosine reports.
- **filter.reads** (TRUE): Whether to drop reads with too few in-context cytosines or high out-of-context methylation.
- **min.mapq** (0): Minimum mapping quality threshold for reads.
- **min.baseq** (0): Minimum base quality threshold.
- **min.prob** (0): Minimum probability threshold for long-read modifications.
- **nthreads** (1): Number of decompression threads to speed up BAM/FASTA reading.

## Best Practices
- Preprocess large BAM files once using `preprocessBam` and pass the resulting object to downstream reporting functions to save time.
- For paired-end short-read data, ensure the BAM file is sorted by QNAME (unsorted) so that `preprocessBam` can merge overlapping read pairs correctly.
- Keep `filter.reads=TRUE` for short-read bisulfite or enzymatic sequencing to remove reads from incompletely converted DNA molecules.

## Common Pitfalls
- Running `preprocessBam` on a location-sorted paired-end BAM: Sort by QNAME first using `samtools sort -n`.
- Missing XG/XM tags in short-read BAMs: Run `callMethylation` with a preprocessed reference genome first.

## Alternatives
- `Bismark` or `Modkit` for general methylation extraction.
