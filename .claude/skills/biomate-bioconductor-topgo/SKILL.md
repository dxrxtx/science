# topGO

## Dependencies & Environment

> Package-intrinsic requirements from the Bioconductor landing page — reproduce in any R environment.

- **Version:** 2.64.0 · **Bioconductor:** 3.23 · **R:** ≥ 4.6
- **Depends:** BiocGenerics, graph, Biobase, GO.db, AnnotationDbi, SparseM
- **Imports:** lattice, matrixStats, DBI
- **Install:** `BiocManager::install("topGO")`

## When to Use
- Performing Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis using the `runTest` function on gene lists derived from differential expression.
- Accounting for the hierarchical structure and dependencies of the GO DAG using algorithms like `elim`, `weight`, or `weight01`.
- Testing enrichment using continuous statistical tests (e.g., Kolmogorov-Smirnov via `statistic = "ks"`) on gene scores rather than just binary gene lists.
- Visualizing the subgraph induced by the most significant GO terms using `showSigOfNodes`.

## When NOT to Use
- For pathway databases other than Gene Ontology (e.g., KEGG, Reactome) (use `clusterProfiler` because `topGO` is strictly designed for GO graph topologies).
- For fast, simple over-representation analysis without graph-topology correction (use `gprofiler2` or `enrichR` because `topGO` builds complex local graph structures which takes more time).

## Data Requirements
- A named vector of gene identifiers with associated scores (e.g., p-values) or a binary factor (0/1) indicating interesting genes.
- A mapping between gene identifiers and GO terms (e.g., via a Bioconductor annotation package like `hgu95av2.db`, or custom mappings read by `readMappings`).

## Key Parameters
- **ontology** ("BP"): Character string specifying the ontology of interest; must be "BP", "MF", or "CC".
- **allGenes** (none): Named vector of type numeric or factor defining the gene universe and their scores/status.
- **geneSelectionFun** (none): Function to specify which genes are interesting based on the gene scores (e.g., `topDiffGenes`).
- **nodeSize** (10): Integer used to prune the GO hierarchy from terms which have fewer than this many annotated genes.
- **annot** (annFUN.db): Function which maps gene identifiers to GO terms (e.g., `annFUN.db`, `annFUN.gene2GO`, `annFUN.org`).
- **algorithm** ("weight01"): Method for dealing with the GO graph structure in `runTest` (e.g., "classic", "elim", "weight", "parentchild").
- **statistic** ("fisher"): The test statistic to use in `runTest` (e.g., "fisher", "ks", "t").

## Best Practices
- Filter out genes with low expression or small variability using `genefilter` before defining the gene universe to improve computational efficiency.
- Compare results from multiple algorithms (e.g., `classic` vs `elim`) using `GenTable` to see how topology correction affects the significance of parent/child terms.
- Use `inverseList` to easily transform custom mappings from gene-to-GOs to GO-to-genes when preparing custom annotations.
- Use `score` to extract p-values from a `topGOresult` object for custom plotting or comparisons.

## Common Pitfalls
- **Providing custom annotations with excessive redundancy**: Slows down the analysis significantly. Fix: Provide only the most specific GO annotations in the custom mapping file; `topGO` handles the ancestor propagation.
- **Assuming all input genes are used**: Not all genes in the provided `allGenes` list can be annotated to GO. Fix: Check the `topGOdata` summary to see the actual number of "feasible genes" used in the analysis.
- **Using incompatible algorithms and statistics**: Some statistical tests do not work with every method (e.g., `ks` with `parentchild`). Fix: Consult the compatibility matrix and use supported combinations like `elim` with `ks` or `classic` with `fisher`.

## Alternatives
- **clusterProfiler**: For versatile enrichment analysis supporting multiple databases (GO, KEGG, MSigDB) and rich visualizations.
- **goseq**: For GO enrichment of RNA-seq data while correcting for gene length bias.
- **enrichR**: For fast, web-based enrichment analysis across dozens of gene set libraries.
