# GOSemSim

`GOSemSim` is an R package designed for semantic similarity analysis among Gene Ontology (GO) terms and gene products.

## Dependencies & Environment

> Package-intrinsic requirements from the Bioconductor landing page — reproduce in any R environment.

- **Version:** 2.38.0 · **Bioconductor:** 3.23 · **R:** ≥ 4.6
- **Imports:** AnnotationDbi, DBI, digest, GO.db, rlang, yulab.utils
- **Install:** `BiocManager::install("GOSemSim")`

## When to Use
- Measuring semantic similarity among GO terms.
- Computing functional similarity among gene products.
- Performing GO semantic similarity analyses within stem cell transcriptional networks or other biomedical contexts.

## When NOT to Use
- For general biomedical knowledge mining tasks that do not involve Gene Ontology semantic similarity, refer to broader biomedical knowledge mining resources.
- When performing analyses that do not require quantitative semantic comparisons of GO annotations.

## Data Requirements
- Gene Ontology (GO) annotations.
- Gene and gene product datasets requiring functional similarity comparison.

## Key Parameters
- No specific R function parameters are detailed in the provided short vignette text. Please refer to the external full documentation for parameter specifications.

## Best Practices
- Refer to the comprehensive online book (https://yulab-smu.top/biomedical-knowledge-mining-book/) for the full vignette, detailed workflows, and tutorials.
- When seeking assistance, post questions to the Bioconductor support site and tag the post with `GOSemSim`.
- Cite the appropriate primary publications when using `GOSemSim` in published research.

## Common Pitfalls
- Searching for detailed code examples in the package's built-in short vignette; fix this by visiting the external online biomedical knowledge mining book for the complete documentation.
- Failing to tag support questions properly; fix this by tagging posts with `GOSemSim` on the Bioconductor support site.

## Alternatives
- Other Bioconductor packages designed for functional annotation and enrichment analysis (though `GOSemSim` is specifically focused on semantic similarity).
